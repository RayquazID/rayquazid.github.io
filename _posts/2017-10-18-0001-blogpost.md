title: Introducing TheNOPSled
---

this is the first entry on "\x90\x90\x90" TheNOPSled.

Here you will find Write-Up, Know-How-Nudgets, Tools and Books I recommand.
Also i will talk about my daily struggles with everything and everyone around IT to show that none is perfect and maybe document some of my hardware hacks and private building projects like my poor-mans-iLO. 
I'm not the most expirienced Hacker on earth, but maybe I can help some of you to finde a good start into the fields.

If you like what you see - you can donate me by following my coinhive-Shortlinks or just run my miner a few minutes.
