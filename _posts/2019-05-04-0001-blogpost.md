This is gonna be my first Write-up since my journey in InfoSec started. I want to lead you all a little bit throughout my process of thought and my approach on breaking this chall. 

We were presented with a small but helpful introduction.

There are a few takeaway's here. We will come back later on but it clearly states the use of a "new secret evil handshake" and in particular the Note further down is pointing to your network setup. Cause i never heard of the following, this did'nt pull the magic trigger in my brain.

So - on to what else we have.
There is a .pcap supplied with the chall. Let's fire up a wireshark and see what we can extract from it.



```python
