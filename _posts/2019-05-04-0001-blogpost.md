This is gonna be my first Write-up since my journey in InfoSec started. I want to lead you all a little bit throughout my process of thought and my approach on breaking this chall. 

We were presented with a small but helpful introduction.

I'm trying to break into the EVIL club and I've figured out their password. I still can't get in though because they now have a new secret evil handshake. I've attached what I captured from the old handshake, maybe it will help.

nc 35.155.188.29 8000

(Note: be careful trying this problem in a "non-standard" networking setup).


```bash
subl exploit.py
```bash
